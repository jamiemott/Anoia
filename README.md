# Anoia
This is a text-based game in which the player acts as Anoia, Goddess of Annoyance (based on the character in the Terry Pratchett Discworld books).  At the beginning, Anoia is a low-level diety currently in charge of getting items stuck in drawers to annoy humans.  It is the players job, as Anoia, to travel the world annoying humans to build power and increase her abilities.
